# mothercare
"Mother Care - For your Loved Ones" is offering an emergency health care solution for pregnant women. As we are 
passing through a pandemic, it’s really difficult sometimes finding emergency products and maternity 
instruments in this hard time. Here we're gathering all of them in an online shop. 
    The project took almost 13 days to shape like the video provided below.
